My dear Frodo.
You asked me one once if I My dear Frodo.
You asked me one once if I had told you everything there was to know about my adventures.And while I can honestly say I have told you the truth, I may not have told you all of it.
I am old now, Frodo. I'm not the same Hobbit I once was.
I think it is time for you to know what really happened. It began long ago in a land far away tothe east, the like of which you will not find in the world today.
There was the city of Dale. Its markets known far and wide, full of the bounties of vine andvale. Peaceful, and prosperous. For this city lay before the doors of the greatest kingdom inMiddle­earth: Erebor. Stronghold of Thror, King under the Mountain, mightiest of the dwarf lords.
Thror ruled with utter surety, never doubting his house would endure, for his line lay securein the lives of his son and grandson. Ahhh, Frodo, Erebor; built deep within the mountain itself, thebeauty of this fortress city was legend.
Its wealth lay in the earth, in precious gems hewed from rock, and in great seams of gold,running like rivers through stone. The skill of the dwarves was unequaled, fashioning objects of greatbeauty out of diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire. Ever they delved deeper, down into the dark. Andthat is where they found it. The heart of the mountain. The Arkenstone. Thror named it the King'sJewel. He took it as a sign, a sign that his his right to rule was divine. All would pay homage to him,even the great Elvenking, Thranduil.
But the years of peace and plenty were not to last. Slowly, the days turned sour, and thewatchful nights closed in. Thror's love of gold had grown too fierce. A sickness had begun to growwithin him; it was a sickness of the mind. And where sickness thrives, bad things will follow.
The first they heard was a noise like a hurricane coming down from the north. The pines onthe mountain creaked and cracked in a hot, dry wind.
It was a fire drake from the north. Smaug had come.
Such wanton death was dealt that day, for this city of men was nothing to Smaug; his eye wasset on another prize. For dragons covet gold, with a dark and fierce desire.
Erebor was lost, for a dragon will guard his plunder as long as he lives.
Thranduil would not risk the lives of his kin against the wrath of the dragon. No help camefrom the elves that day, or any day since.
Robbed of their homeland, the dwarves of Erebor wandered the wilderness, a once mightypeople brought low.
The young dwarf prince took work where he could find it, laboring in the villages of men, butalways he remembered the mountain smoke beneath the moon, the trees like torches blazing bright,for he had seen dragon fire in the sky, and his city turned to ash, and never forgave, and he neverforgot.
That, my dear Frodo, is where I come in. For quite by chance, and the will of a Wizard, fatedecided I would become part of this tale. It began, well, it began as you might expect. In a hole in theground, there lived a Hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, full of worms and oozy smells; this was aHobbit­hole, and that means good food, a warm hearth, and all the comforts of home.
Thank you.
That is private. Keep your sticky paws off. It's not ready yet.
Reading.
What on earth are these?
Oh! Good gracious! Is it today?
Are they, indeed? Over my dead body.
It was one small chest, hardly overflowing. And it still smells of troll.
Taking precautions. You know, I caught her making off with the silverware once.
Lobelia Sackville­Baggins. She had all my spoons stuffed in her pockets. Hah! Dreadfulwoman; make sure you keep an eye on her after I'm ... when I'm ... when I'm...
It's nothing. Nothing.
Odd? Hmm.
Unsociable? Me? Nonsense. Be a good lad and put that on the gate.
Who?
Ahhh. He wouldn't miss a chance to lit up his whiz­poppers! He'll give us quite a show, you'llsee.
Off to where?
Well, go on then! You don't want to be late.
He doesn't approve of being late. Not that I ever was. In those days, I was always on time. Iwas entirely respectable. And nothing unexpected ever happened.
Good morning.
All of them at once, I suppose.
Can I help you?
An adventure? Now, I don't imagine anyone west of Bree would have much interest inadventures. Nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things. Make you late for dinner, hm, mm
Good morning.
Beg your pardon?
I'm sorry, do I know you?
Gandalf...not Gandalf, the wandering Wizard, who made such excellent fireworks! Old Tookused to have them on Midsummer's Eve. Ha, ha! Well. Hmm, I had no idea you were still in business.
Ha, ha! Hm, hmm...
Inform the who? What? No. No. No! Wait. We do not want any adventures here, thank you. Nottoday, not­mm. I suggest you try over the Hill or across the Water. Good morning.
Ah.
Bilbo Baggins, at yours.
D­do we know each other?
I­is what down where?
H­He said? Who said?
What? Uh, oh, yes, yes
Help yourself.
Mmmm. It's just that, um, I wasn't expecting company.
Good evening.
Late for what?
Uh, excuse me; sorry, I hate to interrupt, ah, but the thing is, I'm not entirely sure you're inthe right house.
It's not that I don't like visitors; I­I like visitors as much as the next Hobbit, but I do like toknow them before they come visiting.
The thing is, um­­
The thing is, um, I, I don't know either of you, not in the slightest. I don't mean to be blunt, butI uh, but I had to speak my mind. I'm sorry.
Mm!
Nope, you can't come in, you've come to the wrong house.
Can­­? No­­nothing's been cancelled.
Ah, no, it's been in the family for years. That's my mother's glory box, can you please not dothat?!
Ev­­everyone? How many more are there?
Oh no. No, no! There's nobody home. Go away, and bother somebody else. There's far toomany dwarves in my dining room as it is. If­ if­ If this is some clotterd's idea of a joke, ha ha, I can onlysay, it is in very poor taste.
Gandalf.
Those are my plates! Excuse me! Not my wine. Put that back. Put that back! Not the jam,please! ...Excuse me.
Excuse me. A tad excessive, isn't it? Have you got a cheese knife?
No, no, that's Grandpa Mungo's chair! No, I'm sorry, you'll have to take it back please. Take itback...It's antique, not for sitting on! Thank you! That's a book, not a coaster. Put that map down, thankyou.
Excuse me, that is a doily, not a dishcloth!
It's supposed to look like that, it's crochet.
Bebother and confusticate these dwarves!
What's the matter? I'm surrounded by dwarves. What are they doing here?
I don't want to get used to them. The state of my kitchen! There's mud trod into the carpet,they've pi­pillaged the pantry. I'm not even going to tell you what they've done in the bathroom;they've all but destroyed the plumbing. I don't understand what they're doing in my house!
Excuse me, that's my mother's West Farthing crockery, it's over a hundred years old!
And can­can you not do that? You'll blunt them!
Mark? There's no mark on that door. It was painted a week ago!
Pardon me?
Well, I have some skill at Conkers, if you must know, but I fail to see why that's relevant.
You're going on a quest?
Uh, What beast?
Yes, I know what a dragon is.
Hm, A good one, too. An expert, I'd imagine.
Am I what?
M­­Me? No, no, no, no, no. I'm not a burglar; I've never stolen a thing in my life.
No, no, no.
Please.
Funeral arrangements?
Huh.
Uh, yeah...Feel a bit faint.
Air, I­­I­­I need air.
Hmmm. Nope.
I'll be all right, let me just sit quietly for a moment.
I can't just go running off into the blue. I am a Baggins, of Bag End.
Yes.
I do believe you made that up.
Can you promise that I will come back?
That's what I thought. Sorry, Gandalf, I can't sign this. You've got the wrong Hobbit.
Hello?
Can't stop, I'm already late!
I'm going on an adventure!
Wait! Wait!
I signed it!
No, no, no, no, that­­that won't be necessary, thank you, but I­­I'm sure I can keep up on foot.I­­ I­­I've done my fair share of walking holidays, you know. I even got as far as Frogmortononce­­WAGH!
What's that about?
What did you think?
Ohh. All this horse hair, I'm having a reaction.
No, no, wait, wait, stop! Stop! We have to turn around.
I forgot my handkerchief.
Hello, girl. That's a good girl. It's our little secret, Myrtle; you must tell no one. sh, sh
What was that?
Orcs?
But the pale orc? What happened to him?
Are there any?
Other wizards?
And who is the fifth?
Is he a great Wizard or is he...more like you?
Everything alright? Gandalf, where are you going?
Who's that?
He's been a long time.
Gandalf.
What's the matter?
Well, that's not good. That is not good at all. Shouldn't we tell Thorin?
Well, uh...look, some­­something big uprooted these trees.
Something very big, and possibly quite dangerous.
What is it?
He's got Myrtle and Minty! I think they're going to eat them, we have to do something.
N­­n­­no­­
No, no, no...
Twice like a barn owl, twice like a brown­­once like a brown? Are you sure this is a goodidea?
I'm a burglar­­ uhh, Hobbit.
Nope.
No I'm not!
Wait! You are making a terrible mistake.
Uh, I meant with the, uh, with, uh, with the seasoning.
Well have you smelt them? You're going to need something stronger than sage before youplate this lot up.
Uh, th­­the secret to cooking dwarf is, um­­
It's, uh­­
Ye­­yes, I'm telling you, the secret is to skin them first!
Not­­not that one, he­­he's infected!
Yeah, He's got worms in his tubes.
In­­in fact they all have, they're in­­infested with parasites. It's a terrible business; I wouldn'trisk it, I really wouldn't.
Well...
Ferret?
Hmm?
I can't take this.
I have never used a sword in my life.
Gandalf­
Was that a wolf? Are there­­are there wolves out there?
Orc pack?
Rivendell.
What are you saying, my sword hasn't seen battle?
Durin's Day?
Time? For what?
Back to Rivendell.
I'm not though, am I? Thorin said I should never have come, and he was right. I'm not a Took,I'm a Baggins, I don't know what I was thinking. I should never have run out my door.
No, you don't, you don't understand! None of you do ­ you're dwarves. You used to ­ to thislife, to living on the road, never settling in one place, not belonging anywhere.
I am sorry, I didn't...
Back. Stay back. I'm warning you, don't come any closer.
My name is Bilbo Baggins.
I'm a Hobbit from the Shire.
Now, now, K­­keep your distance! I'll use this if I have to!
I don't want any trouble, do you understand? Just show me the way to get out of here, and I'llbe on my way.
Yes, yes, and I want to get unlost as soon as possible.
I didn't say anything.
Look, uh, I don't know what your game is, but I­­
Maybe?
...The mountain.
No! No, no, no. I wa I want to play. I do. I want to play. I can see you are very good at this.S so why don't we have a game of riddles? Yes, just, just you and me.
Yes. Yes. And and if I win, you show me the way out.
Fair enough.
Thirty white horses on a red hill. First they champ, then they stamp, then they stand still.
Just a minute.
Wind. It's wind! Of course it is.
Ah, ah, ah, ah. A a box without hinges, key, o or, or lid; yet golden treasure inside is hid.
Well?
Give up?
Give me a moment, please, I gave you a good long while.
I don't know this one.
Let me think. Let me think.
Time. Ti the answer is time.
Actually, it wasn't that hard.
Ah, uh....
Yes, yes, alright.
What have I got in my pocket?
No, no, no, no. You said Ask me a question.' Well, that is my question. What have I got in mypocket?
Three guesses. Very well, guess away.
Wrong, guess again.
Wrong again. Last guess.
Two guesses at once; wrong both times.
So, come then, I won the game, you promised to show me the way out.
That's no concern of yours. You lost.
What have you lost?
No, he isn't.
Look, I know you doubt me, I know you always have. And you're right, I often think of Bag End.I miss my books. And my armchair. And my garden. See, that's where I belong. That's home. And that'swhy I came back, cause you don't have one. A home. It was taken from you. But I will help you take itback if I can.
No, I would have doubted me too. I'm not a hero or a warrior...not even a burglar.
Is that what I think it is?had told you everything there was to know about my adventures.And while I can honestly say I have told you the truth, I may not have told you all of it.
